# Cyphon

Low Bandwidth DoS (Denial of Service) tool written for Mac OS X based on RSnake's Slow Loris. 



# Motivation

I decided to code an executable OSX version for Mac OS users as there isn't any server load testers out there for the Mac OS.

SlowLoris seemed to be the best solution for a Mac DoS tool due to its ability of being a low bandwidth yet poisonous HTTP client and it's ability to work from a single IP address sending partial HTTP requests.

# Mitigating the attacks 

- Use Cloud fare
- Increase the number of clients your server can host.
