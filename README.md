# Cyphon

Low Bandwidth DoS (Denial of Service) tool written for Mac OS X based on RSnake's Slow Loris. 

# Code Example

I coded the executable in Objective C and Applescript using Xcode. Refer to AppDelegate.applescript.

# Motivation

I decided to code an executable OSX version for Mac OS users as there isn't any server load testers out there for the Mac OS.

SlowLoris seemed to be the best solution for a Mac DoS tool due to its ability of being a low bandwidth yet poisonous HTTP client by using a single IP address to send several partial HTTP requests.
